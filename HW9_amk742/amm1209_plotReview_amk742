CLARITY:
The histogram used to analyze the distribution of birth year of city ridership, is very clear and in straightforward in term of the title of the graph. The plot uses an appropriate colors. However, the size of the bar of the plot was a little bit cluttered up. I would recommend to use a larger size of histogram.  
AESTHETIC:
Color choice of the histogram plot was very easy to follow by using the threshold value with the red line. The caption of the plot could have been more descriptive. 

HONESTY:
Overall, the plotted histogram is good and seems to follow the data honestly throughout the using the process of analyzing the data
