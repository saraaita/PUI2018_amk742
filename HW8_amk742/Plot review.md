The plot contains the main elements such as the title, axis, caption, and the choice of main and background colours is good.
The plot is missing a legend to convey what each of these elements: the scatter points, the line, and the transparent buffer. 
Moreover, assuming that these elements convey different information, giving each element a different colour or hue can make 
them easier to interpret, especially if the plot's goal is comparing between them.
Since the caption of the plot mentions only two variables, it might be unnecassary to include 
that much elements. A scatter or a line would have been sufficient.
